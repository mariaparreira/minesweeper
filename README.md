# MINESWEEPER

## How to Play

_This minesweeper game is 1 player and beginner mode._
_The user should run the code and play on the console._

Once the game shows on the console, it will be prompted for the player to enter coordinates, first row and then column with a space in between.

If the player misspells, the input will be invalid and the player will be prompted again to enter coordinates.

To win the game, the player just needs to follow the numbers, to not touch the mines.

## Missing

The flags are not implemented.

Sometimes the board only places 9 mines (idk why).

Should implement a way so players can have a name.

Should implement a way to save the timer to put it on a ranking board, so players can compare scores.

Also, having more levels would be fun.
